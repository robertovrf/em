# Emergent Microservice

This project presents the first implementation of the concept of Emergent Microservice. These microservices are capable of changing their internal architectural composition to improve performance (i.e., reduce response time) as the system executes. Furthermore, in this project we also make available scripts that allow one to experiment with our concept in an elastic environment, executing the emergent microservice in a Kubernetes-managed cluster. Below we detail how you can compile the project and execute the project's experiments.
